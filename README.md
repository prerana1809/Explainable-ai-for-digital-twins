# Explainable Data-Driven Digital Twins for Predicting Battery States in Electric Vehicles
This project focuses on developing a system to predict the State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) of electric vehicle batteries. 
By leveraging digital twins, advanced deep learning models (DNN and LSTM), and explainable AI techniques, the aim is to provide accurate and interpretable predictions to enhance battery management systems (BMS). The ultimate goal is to improve battery efficiency, safety, and lifespan in electric vehicles.
